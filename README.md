# LocalLibrary

Created a basic library website with a database that is connected to mongoDB that tracks the inventory of books. Users have access to create books, genre, and authors and have
the access to delete them. Website made using express, node.js, pug.

Made with the help of Express tutorial on Mozilla Developers Network. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website
